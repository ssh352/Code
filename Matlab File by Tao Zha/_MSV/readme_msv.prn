When eu=[0,1] in the original gensys setup, it means that in our MSV setting that exogenous persistence is put
  in a wrong place when we reorder the roots.  Thus, there is no such [0,1] return in our MSV solution.

When eu=[1,0] in the original gensys setup, it means that the MSV solution must exist with another order.  See
  example3_10_sw.m in D:\ZhaData\WorkDisk\LiuWZ\ZhaNotes\UnderstandingMSV\OneDimentionCaseImportant.

With our MSV solution, we abuse the notation eu=[1,0], which really means that we have multiple MSV solutions.
  But multiple MSV solutions can occur only in complex numbers.  The imaginary part of the solution can be scaled
  arbitrarily, which gives sunspot solutions.  Thus, the real MSV solution will be unique.

If we encourter eu=[3,?], it means that all MSV solutions are explosive.  Thus, no stable MSV solution.



========================= New files for MSV solutions ==============================
msv_complex_AR.m: gives an MSV solution (upon the order that first works) with a flag indicating if [1,0].  If
                    [1;0], the complex solution exits and thus the MSV solution is NOT unique.
                    AR: autoregressive or gensys form;
msv_all_complex_AR.m: gives all MSV-like solutions (including complex solutions).  That is, all the solutions that
                        come from the undetermined coefficients method.


========================= Old files for MSV solutions ==============================
msv_simple.m:  works only for the first order if an msv solution (even if it is non-unique where the solution is
                 complex) exist.  It does not try the second order (where the exogenous persistence may be larger
                 than the endogenous persistence).

msv_one.m: works only for the unqiue MSV solution (thus, no complex solution) for the order that comes first.  If no
             solution is found for all orders, then no unique MSV solution (but there may be multiple MSV solutions
             such as a complex solution).

msv_all.m:  gives all MSV-like real solutions (thus, some solutions are NOT an MSV solution).
