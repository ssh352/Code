%      Generate prior period, period-to-period-in-last-year, and annual growth rates
%      For annual rates, works for both calendar and any annual years, depending on Byrqm and Eyrqm
%      If monthly data, we haven't got time to get quarterly growth rates yet.
%
% xdatae:  all data (logged levels or interest rates/100, some of which may be NaN) with the first
%          2 columns indicating years and periods.
% q_m: quarter or month period
% vlistlog: sublist for logged variables
% vlistper: sublists for percent variables
% Byrqm: [year quarter(month)]: beginning year and period.  If Byqm(2)~=1, we don't get
%     calendar annual rates.  In other words, the first column of yactyge (which
%     indicates years) does not mean calendar years.  Byqm(2) must be specified; in other
%     words, it must be not set to 0 as in, say, fn_dataext.
% Eyrqm: [year period]:  end year and period.  Eyqm(2) must be specified; in other words, it
%     must be not set to 0 as in, say, fn_dataext.
%    NOTE: if no inputs Byrqm and Eyrqm are specified, all growth rates begin at xdatae(1,1:2).
%----------
% yactyrge: annual growth rates with dates in the first 2 columns.
% yactyre:  annual average logged level with dates in the 1st 2 columns.
% yactqmyge: period-to-period-in-last-year annual growth rates with dates in the first 2 columns.
% yactqmge:  prior-period annualized growth rates (percent) with dates in the first 2 columns.
% yactqme:  data (logged levels or interest rates/100) with dates in the first 2 columns.
%           Same as xdatae but with Brow:Erow.
