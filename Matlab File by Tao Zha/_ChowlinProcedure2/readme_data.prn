%*********************
When read *.xls, check xdd.  Sometimes, xdd=xdd(:,2:end), but sometimes, xdd = xdd(:,1:end) is fine.

M and MAT files (ordered sequentially in running these files)
-----------------------------------
(1) chowlin.m:  Reads both Datam1104.xls and Dataq1104.xls to interpolate (1) GDP, (2) real bus invest, and (3)
real res invest, using the Chow-Lin procedure. Before running it, check yrFin, qmFin, yrEnd, and qmEnd for
both monthly and quarterly data.  Export outgdp.mat (do NOT rename this until chowlin1.m is performed).

(2) chowlin1.m:  Continued from running chowlin.m and read both Datam1104.xls and Dataq1104.xls to interpolate GDP
deflator. Before running it, check yrFin, qmFin, yrEnd, and qmEnd for both monthly and quarterly data. Add or
append the interpolated data to outgdp.mat.

(3) xdgdp.mat: 59:01-04:09.  The file outgdp.mat produced by chowlin*.m is now renamed as such.

(4) datamg.m:  59:01-04:08.  Produces outxdd.mat that combines the monthly data datam1104.xls and xdgdp.mat
(possibly with a few rows of NaNs added to X2 for the gdp data) to get the final interpolated data of gdp,
deflator, etc. Before running it, check yrFin, qmFin, yrEnd, and qmEnd for monthly data.

(5) xd58.mat: 59:01-04:08.  The file outxdd.mat produced by datamg.m is renamed here.



Adds the Divisia M2 series to xd46.mat.
-----------------------------------
(6) add_divisiaM2.m:  Adds the Divisia M2 to xd58.mat to become xd59.mat.

(7) xd59.mat: 59:01-04:08.  The file outxd.mat produced by add_divisiaM2.m is renamed here.
